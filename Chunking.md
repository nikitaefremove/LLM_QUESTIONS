# 3. Chunking

### 3.1 What is chunking, and why do we chunk our data?

Chunking refers to the process of breaking down large datasets or text into smaller, more manageable pieces or "chunks." In the context of Large Language Models (LLMs), chunking is often used to handle long sequences of text that exceed the model's maximum input length.

We chunk data for several reasons:

1. **Model Constraints**: LLMs have a fixed maximum input length (e.g., 512 or 2048 tokens). Chunking ensures that the input fits within these limits.
2. **Efficiency**: Processing smaller chunks can be more computationally efficient, reducing memory usage and speeding up inference.
3. **Context Management**: Chunking helps manage context windows, ensuring that the model focuses on relevant portions of the text without losing important information.
4. **Parallel Processing**: Smaller chunks can be processed in parallel, improving throughput in distributed systems.

Chunking is crucial for tasks like text summarization, translation, and question answering, where handling long documents is necessary.

### 3.2 What factors influence chunk size?

1. **Model's Maximum Input Length**: The chunk size must fit within the model's token limit (e.g., 512, 1024, or 2048 tokens).  
2. **Task Requirements**: Tasks like summarization or translation may need larger chunks for context, while others like classification may work with smaller chunks.  
3. **Overlap**: Overlapping chunks can preserve context between segments, influencing chunk size.  
4. **Computational Resources**: Larger chunks require more memory and processing power, so resource constraints may limit size.  
5. **Data Structure**: The nature of the data (e.g., sentences, paragraphs, or documents) affects how chunks are divided.  
6. **Performance Trade-offs**: Balancing chunk size for optimal inference speed and accuracy is critical.

### 3.3 What are the different types of chunking methods?

1. **Fixed-Size Chunking**: Divides data into equal-sized chunks based on a predefined token or character limit.  
2. **Sentence-Based Chunking**: Splits text into chunks at sentence boundaries, preserving semantic coherence.  
3. **Paragraph-Based Chunking**: Divides text into chunks at paragraph boundaries, maintaining larger context.  
4. **Sliding Window Chunking**: Overlaps chunks by a fixed number of tokens to ensure context continuity.  
5. **Content-Aware Chunking**: Uses semantic or structural cues (e.g., headings, topics) to split data meaningfully.  
6. **Dynamic Chunking**: Adjusts chunk size based on content complexity or task requirements.

### 3.4 How to find the ideal chunk size?

To find the ideal chunk size:

1. **Understand Model Limits**: Check the model's maximum token limit (e.g., 512, 1024, 2048).
2. **Analyze Task Needs**: Determine if the task requires larger context (e.g., summarization) or smaller chunks (e.g., classification).
3. **Experiment**: Test different chunk sizes (e.g., 256, 512, 1024 tokens) and evaluate performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, latency).
4. **Consider Overlap**: Use overlapping chunks if context continuity is critical.
5. **Balance Resources**: Ensure chunk size aligns with available computational resources.
6. **Iterate**: Refine chunk size based on empirical results and task-specific requirements.
