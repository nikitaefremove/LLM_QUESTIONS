# 6. Advanced Search Algorithms

### 6.1 What are architecture patterns for information retrieval & semantic search?

**Key Architecture Patterns:**

1. **Traditional IR Architecture:**
   - **Inverted Indexing:** Documents are tokenized and normalized into an inverted index for fast term-based lookups.
   - **Query Processing & Ranking:** Uses algorithms like TF-IDF or BM25 to score and rank results based on term frequency and document relevance.

2. **Semantic (Neural) Search Architecture:**
   - **Embedding Generation:** Leverages deep models (e.g., BERT, Sentence Transformers) to convert text into dense vector representations.
   - **Vector Indexing & Retrieval:** Utilizes Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms (e.g., FAISS, HNSW, Annoy) to perform efficient similarity searches in high-dimensional spaces.

3. **Hybrid Search Architecture:**
   - **Combined Lexical and Semantic Retrieval:** Merges traditional keyword matching with vector similarity to cover both exact matches and conceptual relevance.
   - **Multi-Stage Pipeline:** Often starts with a broad candidate retrieval using an inverted index, followed by a semantic re-ranking phase using neural models.

4. **Distributed & Microservices Architecture:**
   - **Scalability & Modularity:** Each component (indexing, embedding, query processing, ranking) can be deployed as an independent service, allowing scalability and easier maintenance.
   - **Real-Time Updates:** Incorporates streaming data pipelines (using tools like Apache Kafka or Flink) for dynamic, up-to-date indexing.

These patterns are selected based on the trade-offs between latency, scalability, and retrieval quality, enabling systems to efficiently handle both traditional term-based queries and more complex semantic queries.
