### 6.1 What are architecture patterns for information retrieval & semantic search?

**Key Architecture Patterns:**

1. **Traditional IR Architecture:**
   - **Inverted Indexing:** Documents are tokenized and normalized into an inverted index for fast term-based lookups.
   - **Query Processing & Ranking:** Uses algorithms like TF-IDF or BM25 to score and rank results based on term frequency and document relevance.

2. **Semantic (Neural) Search Architecture:**
   - **Embedding Generation:** Leverages deep models (e.g., BERT, Sentence Transformers) to convert text into dense vector representations.
   - **Vector Indexing & Retrieval:** Utilizes Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms (e.g., FAISS, HNSW, Annoy) to perform efficient similarity searches in high-dimensional spaces.

3. **Hybrid Search Architecture:**
   - **Combined Lexical and Semantic Retrieval:** Merges traditional keyword matching with vector similarity to cover both exact matches and conceptual relevance.
   - **Multi-Stage Pipeline:** Often starts with a broad candidate retrieval using an inverted index, followed by a semantic re-ranking phase using neural models.

4. **Distributed & Microservices Architecture:**
   - **Scalability & Modularity:** Each component (indexing, embedding, query processing, ranking) can be deployed as an independent service, allowing scalability and easier maintenance.
   - **Real-Time Updates:** Incorporates streaming data pipelines (using tools like Apache Kafka or Flink) for dynamic, up-to-date indexing.

These patterns are selected based on the trade-offs between latency, scalability, and retrieval quality, enabling systems to efficiently handle both traditional term-based queries and more complex semantic queries.

### 6.2 Why it’s important to have very good search

Having very good search algorithms is crucial for LLMs because:

1. **Efficiency**: Advanced search algorithms reduce the computational cost by quickly narrowing down the most relevant information, enabling faster response times.

2. **Accuracy**: They improve the quality of generated outputs by ensuring the model retrieves the most contextually appropriate data or tokens, reducing errors.

3. **Scalability**: Efficient search allows LLMs to handle larger datasets and more complex queries without a significant drop in performance.

4. **User Experience**: Better search leads to more coherent and contextually relevant responses, enhancing user satisfaction.

5. **Resource Optimization**: Minimizes unnecessary computations, saving energy and computational resources, which is critical for large-scale deployments.

---

### 6.3 How can you achieve efficient and accurate search results in large-scale datasets?

To achieve efficient and accurate search results in large-scale datasets, consider the following strategies:

1. **Indexing**: Use data structures like inverted indexes, B-trees, or hash tables to quickly locate relevant data points.
2. **Vector Search**: Employ vector embeddings and similarity search techniques (e.g., cosine similarity, Euclidean distance) for semantic search in high-dimensional spaces.
3. **Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN)**: Utilize ANN algorithms (e.g., FAISS, Annoy, HNSW) to trade off a small amount of accuracy for significant speed improvements.
4. **Partitioning**: Divide the dataset into smaller, manageable chunks using techniques like sharding or clustering (e.g., k-means) to reduce search space.
5. **Caching**: Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to store frequently accessed results and reduce redundant computations.
6. **Parallelization**: Leverage distributed computing frameworks (e.g., Spark, Hadoop) to parallelize search operations across multiple nodes.
7. **Query Optimization**: Optimize search queries by filtering, pruning, or reordering operations to minimize computational overhead.
8. **Preprocessing**: Clean and normalize data (e.g., tokenization, stemming) to improve search accuracy and efficiency.

Combining these techniques can significantly enhance both the speed and precision of search operations in large-scale datasets.

### 6.4 Consider a scenario where a client has already built a RAG-based system that is not giving accurate results, upon investigation you find out that the retrieval system is not accurate, what steps you will take to improve it?

1. **Evaluate Retrieval Model**: Assess the current retrieval model (e.g., BM25, DPR) to identify weaknesses. Check if it’s retrieving relevant documents or if the embeddings are poorly aligned with the query context.

2. **Improve Query Understanding**: Enhance query preprocessing (e.g., stemming, stopword removal, or query expansion) to better match the document corpus.

3. **Fine-tune Embeddings**: Fine-tune the retriever’s embeddings on domain-specific data to improve relevance. Use contrastive learning or triplet loss for better alignment between queries and documents.

4. **Expand Corpus**: Ensure the document corpus is comprehensive and up-to-date. Add missing relevant documents or remove outdated ones.

5. **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combine dense retrieval (e.g., DPR) with sparse retrieval (e.g., BM25) to leverage the strengths of both methods.

6. **Re-rank Results**: Introduce a re-ranking step using a cross-encoder or fine-tuned model to improve the ranking of retrieved documents.

7. **Optimize Indexing**: Ensure the document index is optimized for fast and accurate retrieval. Consider using approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search for large-scale datasets.

8. **Evaluate Metrics**: Use metrics like recall@k, precision@k, or MRR to measure retrieval performance and identify specific areas for improvement.

9. **User Feedback**: Incorporate user feedback to iteratively refine the retrieval system and align it with user expectations.

10. **Experiment & Iterate**: Continuously experiment with different retrieval strategies, models, and hyperparameters, and iterate based on performance metrics.

### 6.5 Explain the keyword-based retrieval method

Keyword-based retrieval is a method used in information retrieval systems to find documents or data that contain specific keywords or phrases. The process typically involves the following steps:

1. **Indexing**: Documents are preprocessed and indexed, creating a mapping of keywords to the documents where they appear. This often includes tokenization, stemming, and removing stop words.

2. **Query Processing**: The user's query is processed similarly to the documents, extracting keywords and applying the same preprocessing steps.

3. **Matching**: The system matches the query keywords against the indexed keywords. Documents containing the query keywords are retrieved.

4. **Ranking**: Retrieved documents are often ranked based on relevance, which can be determined by factors like keyword frequency, document length, and the presence of keywords in important parts of the document (e.g., title, headings).

5. **Output**: The system returns a list of relevant documents, often with snippets or summaries highlighting the matched keywords.

This method is straightforward but can be limited by issues like synonymy (different words with the same meaning) and polysemy (words with multiple meanings), which can affect retrieval accuracy.

---

### 6.6 How to fine-tune re-ranking models?

Fine-tuning re-ranking models typically involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Collect a labeled dataset with query-document pairs and relevance scores. Ensure the dataset is representative of the target domain.

2. **Model Selection**: Choose a pre-trained model (e.g., BERT, T5) that can be adapted for re-ranking tasks.

3. **Loss Function**: Define an appropriate loss function, such as pairwise or listwise loss, to optimize the model for ranking.

4. **Training**: Fine-tune the model on the labeled dataset using techniques like gradient descent. Use techniques like learning rate scheduling and early stopping to prevent overfitting.

5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using metrics like NDCG, MAP, or MRR on a validation set to ensure it generalizes well.

6. **Deployment**: Deploy the fine-tuned model in the production environment, ensuring it integrates seamlessly with the existing search pipeline.

7. **Continuous Improvement**: Monitor performance and periodically retrain the model with new data to maintain relevance.

### 6.7 Explain most common metric used in information retrieval and when it fails?

**Precision** is one of the most common metrics in information retrieval. It’s defined as the ratio of relevant documents retrieved to the total number of documents retrieved. For example, if a system returns 10 documents and 7 are relevant, the precision is 0.7.

**When It Fails:**

- **Ignoring Recall:** Precision alone doesn’t account for relevant documents that were missed. A system might return very few documents (achieving high precision) while missing many relevant ones.
- **Ranking Insensitivity:** It doesn’t consider the order of results. Even if relevant documents appear lower in the ranked list, precision treats all retrieved documents equally.
- **Sparse Returns:** In cases where very few documents are returned, high precision can be misleading because the system may not be covering the breadth of relevant information.

Thus, while precision is simple and intuitive, it should often be complemented with metrics like recall, F1-score, or ranking-aware metrics (e.g., Mean Average Precision, NDCG) for a fuller evaluation of retrieval performance.

### 6.8 If you were to create an algorithm for a Quora-like question-answering system, with the objective of ensuring users find the most pertinent answers as quickly as possible, which evaluation metric would you choose to assess the effectiveness of your system?

For a **Quora-like question-answering system**, where the goal is to **deliver the most relevant answers quickly**, the best evaluation metric would be **Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)**.  

#### **Why NDCG?**  

1. **Accounts for Ranking** – Prioritizes highly relevant answers appearing earlier in the list.  
2. **Handles Multiple Relevance Levels** – Supports graded relevance (e.g., best answer, useful answer, less relevant).  
3. **Discounts Lower-ranked Answers** – Ensures that a correct but buried answer contributes less to the score.  

#### **Alternative Metrics:**  

- **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)** – If the goal is to optimize for **finding the first correct answer quickly**, MRR is useful but doesn't consider other relevant answers.  
- **Precision@k / Recall@k** – Good for binary relevance but doesn’t account for ranking order.  
- **Mean Average Precision (MAP)** – Effective for evaluating multiple relevant answers but lacks position-based discounting like NDCG.  

#### **Conclusion:**  

NDCG is the most suitable metric as it balances ranking quality, multiple relevance levels, and user experience, ensuring that users find the best answers as fast as possible.

### 6.9 I have a recommendation system, which metric should I use to evaluate the system?

For evaluating a recommendation system, the choice of metric depends on the specific goals of your system. Common metrics include:

1. **Precision@K**: Measures the proportion of relevant items in the top-K recommendations.
2. **Recall@K**: Measures the proportion of relevant items retrieved out of all relevant items.
3. **Mean Average Precision (MAP)**: Averages precision@K across all users, considering the order of recommendations.
4. **Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)**: Evaluates the ranking quality, giving higher weight to top recommendations.
5. **Hit Rate**: Measures the fraction of users for whom at least one relevant item is recommended.
6. **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)**: Evaluates the rank of the first relevant item in the recommendation list.

Choose based on whether you prioritize relevance, ranking, or user engagement.

---

### 6.10 Compare different information retrieval metrics and which one to use when?

Here’s a brief comparison of common information retrieval metrics and their use cases:

1. **Precision**: Measures the proportion of retrieved documents that are relevant. Use when false positives are costly (e.g., spam filtering).

2. **Recall**: Measures the proportion of relevant documents that are retrieved. Use when missing relevant items is costly (e.g., legal document retrieval).

3. **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall. Use when you need a balance between precision and recall.

4. **Average Precision (AP)**: Summarizes precision-recall trade-off for a single query. Use for evaluating ranked retrieval systems.

5. **Mean Average Precision (MAP)**: Average of AP across multiple queries. Use for comparing overall performance across queries.

6. **NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)**: Measures ranking quality, considering the position of relevant items. Use for evaluating search engines where ranking order matters.

7. **R-Precision**: Precision at R, where R is the number of relevant documents. Use when the number of relevant documents is known.

8. **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)**: Focuses on the rank of the first relevant document. Use for tasks like question answering where the first correct answer is critical.

Choose the metric based on the specific requirements of your task, such as the importance of ranking, relevance, or avoiding false positives/negatives.

---

### 6.11 How does hybrid search works?

Hybrid search combines multiple search techniques, typically integrating traditional keyword-based search with vector-based semantic search. Here's how it works:

1. **Keyword Search**: Matches exact or similar terms in the query to the document's text, useful for precise matches.
2. **Semantic Search**: Uses embeddings (vector representations) to capture the meaning of the query and documents, enabling similarity-based retrieval even if exact keywords don't match.
3. **Ranking Fusion**: Results from both methods are combined, often using a weighted score or re-ranking approach, to produce a final ranked list that leverages the strengths of both techniques.

This approach improves recall (finding relevant documents) and precision (ranking them correctly), especially in complex queries.

---

### 6.12 If you have search results from multiple methods, how would you merge and homogenize the rankings into a single result set?

To merge and homogenize search results from multiple methods into a single result set, you can use techniques like:

1. **Score Normalization**: Normalize scores from different methods to a common scale (e.g., 0 to 1) to make them comparable.
2. **Rank Aggregation**: Use methods like Borda Count, Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), or CombSUM/CombMNZ to combine ranks from different methods.
3. **Weighted Fusion**: Assign weights to each method based on their importance or performance, then combine scores using weighted sums.
4. **Learning to Rank (LTR)**: Train a machine learning model to predict the optimal ranking based on features from multiple methods.
5. **Interleaving**: Interleave results from different methods to create a diverse and balanced result set.

Choose the method based on the specific use case and the characteristics of the search methods involved.

---

### 6.13 How to handle multi-hop/multifaceted queries?

1. **Query Decomposition** – Break the query into subqueries using dependency parsing or retrieval-based heuristics.  
2. **Retrieval Pipeline** – Use a **combination of keyword-based (BM25) and semantic (Dense Vector) search** to retrieve relevant documents iteratively.  
3. **Knowledge Graphs** – Leverage structured data to connect entities and infer relationships for multi-hop reasoning.  
4. **Reranking & Fusion** – Apply **Learning-to-Rank (LTR)** or fusion techniques (e.g., Reciprocal Rank Fusion) to prioritize relevant multi-hop results.  
5. **Large Language Models (LLMs) & Agents** – Utilize **LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** to iteratively refine answers using memory/context.  
6. **Context Propagation** – Store intermediate results and use them in follow-up retrieval steps to ensure coherence.  

**Best Approach:** A hybrid of **retrieval, reasoning (LLMs/Knowledge Graphs), and ranking** tailored to query complexity.

---

### 6.14 What are different techniques to be used to improved retrieval?

To improve retrieval in LLMs, consider these techniques:

1. **Dense Retrieval**: Use dense embeddings (e.g., from transformers) to represent queries and documents, enabling semantic similarity matching.
2. **Sparse Retrieval**: Enhance traditional methods like BM25 with term weighting and query expansion.
3. **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combine dense and sparse methods for better coverage and precision.
4. **Re-ranking**: Use a second-stage model (e.g., BERT) to re-rank initial retrieval results for improved relevance.
5. **Query Expansion**: Expand queries with synonyms or related terms using techniques like pseudo-relevance feedback.
6. **Contextual Embeddings**: Leverage contextual embeddings (e.g., from BERT) to capture nuanced query-document relationships.
7. **Cross-Encoder Models**: Use cross-encoders for joint encoding of query-document pairs, improving relevance scoring.
8. **Knowledge Graphs**: Integrate external knowledge graphs to enhance retrieval with structured information.
9. **Active Learning**: Continuously improve retrieval models by actively selecting informative samples for labeling.
10. **Efficient Indexing**: Optimize indexing structures (e.g., FAISS, Annoy) for faster retrieval of dense embeddings.
