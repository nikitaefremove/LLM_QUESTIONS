### 9.1 At which stage you will decide to go for the Preference alignment type of method rather than SFT?

Preference alignment methods (like RLHF or DPO) are typically chosen over Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) when the goal is to align the model's outputs with human preferences or values, rather than just improving task-specific performance. This is usually done after SFT, when the model has already learned the basic task but needs further refinement to produce outputs that are more aligned with human judgments, ethical considerations, or specific user preferences. Preference alignment is particularly useful when the task involves subjective or nuanced outputs, such as generating conversational responses, summarization, or creative content.

### 9.2 What is RLHF, and how is it used?

RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) is a technique used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) by aligning their outputs with human preferences. It involves three main steps:

1. **Supervised Fine-Tuning**: A pre-trained model is fine-tuned on a dataset of human-labeled examples to improve its initial performance.

2. **Reward Modeling**: Human annotators rank or score multiple model outputs for the same input. A reward model is trained to predict these human preferences.

3. **Reinforcement Learning**: The fine-tuned model is further optimized using reinforcement learning (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization) to maximize the reward predicted by the reward model.

RLHF is used to make LLMs more aligned with human values, safer, and more useful in real-world applications like chatbots, content generation, and decision support systems.

### 9.3 What is the reward hacking issue in RLHF?

Reward hacking in RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) occurs when the model learns to exploit the reward function in unintended ways, optimizing for high rewards without actually improving the desired behavior. For example, the model might generate outputs that superficially align with human preferences but lack meaningful content or coherence, simply because those outputs were rewarded during training. This undermines the alignment goals and can lead to suboptimal or harmful behavior.

### 9.4 Explain different preference alignment methods

Preference alignment methods aim to align language models with human preferences. Key methods include:

1. **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**:
   - **Steps**:
     - Collect human-labeled preference data.
     - Train a reward model to predict human preferences.
     - Use reinforcement learning (e.g., PPO) to fine-tune the language model using the reward model.
   - **Advantages**: Effective in aligning models with complex human preferences.
   - **Challenges**: Requires significant computational resources and careful reward model design.

2. **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**:
   - **Approach**: Directly optimizes the language model using preference data without a separate reward model.
   - **Advantages**: Simpler and more computationally efficient than RLHF.
   - **Challenges**: May require large amounts of high-quality preference data.

3. **Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)**:
   - **Approach**: Infers a reward function from observed human behavior and uses it to guide the model.
   - **Advantages**: Can capture nuanced human preferences.
   - **Challenges**: Computationally intensive and requires high-quality behavioral data.

4. **Behavioral Cloning**:
   - **Approach**: Trains the model to mimic human demonstrations directly.
   - **Advantages**: Simple and straightforward.
   - **Challenges**: Limited by the quality and diversity of the demonstration data.

Each method has trade-offs in terms of complexity, data requirements, and alignment effectiveness.
